### Hi 👋

I'm a software engineer (front-end/full-stack) building custom applications to automate business processes, primarily on a cloud platform called ServiceNow.

When I'm not working, I'm usually exercising or finding an excuse to get outside 🏋️ 🏀 🎾 🏃 🥾 🧘‍♂️. I also enjoy listening to conversations and mindfulness practices on a meditation app called [Waking Up](https://www.wakingup.com/).
